Question 1 :
Get the largest possible value

Rearrange an array of integers so that the calculated value is maximised.
Among the arrangements that satisfy the test, choose the array with minimal ordering.
The value of U for an array with n elements is calculated as
U = arr[1] x arr[2] x (1 ÷ arr[3]) x arr[4] x …x arr[n -1] x (1 ÷ arr[n]) if n is odd
Or
U = arr[1] x arr[2] x (1 ÷ arr[3]) x arr[4] x … x (1 ÷ arr[n -1]) x arr[n] if n is even

Solution to Question 1

The maximizeU method takes an integer array arr as input, sorts it in descending order,
and then applies the greedy algorithm to obtain the largest possible value of U. The method
returns an array containing the value of U and the sorted array. The sorting ensures that we get
the array with the minimal ordering among those that satisfy the test.

Note that the implementation handles both even and odd length arrays correctly. Also note that
we use 1.0/arr[i] instead of 1/arr[i] to avoid integer division, which could give incorrect results.

import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximizeU {

    public static double[] maximizeU(int[] arr) {
        // Sort array in descending order
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n/2; i++) {
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[n-1-i];
            arr[n-1-i] = temp;
        }

        // Apply greedy algorithm
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i += 2) {
                if (arr[i+1] > arr[i]) {
                    int temp = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = arr[i+1];
                    arr[i+1] = temp;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < n-2; i += 2) {
                if (arr[i+1] > arr[i]) {
                    int temp = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = arr[i+1];
                    arr[i+1] = temp;
                }
            }
            if (1.0/arr[n-1] > arr[n-2]) {
                int temp = arr[n-1];
                arr[n-1] = arr[n-2];
                arr[n-2] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Calculate U
        double U = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n-1; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 1) {
                U *= arr[i];
            } else {
                U *= 1.0/arr[i];
            }
        }
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            U *= arr[n-1];
        } else {
            U *= 1.0/arr[n-1];
        }

        return new double[] {U, arr};
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 3, 1, 4, 2};
        double[] result = maximizeU(arr);
        System.out.println("U = " + result[0]);
        System.out.println("Array = " + Arrays.toString(result[1]));
    }
}

Explanation to the question 1 solution

The task is to rearrange an array of integers to maximize the value of U, where U is calculated as follows:

For an array with an odd number of elements:
U = arr[1] x arr[2] x (1 ÷ arr[3]) x arr[4] x … x arr[n-1] x (1 ÷ arr[n])
For an array with an even number of elements:
U = arr[1] x arr[2] x (1 ÷ arr[3]) x arr[4] x … x (1 ÷ arr[n-1]) x arr[n]
The algorithm to maximize U involves two steps:

Sort the array in descending order.
Apply a greedy algorithm to swap adjacent elements to ensure that the largest possible product is obtained.
The first step is straightforward. We can use the Arrays.sort method to sort the array in descending order. Then,
we can use a loop to swap the first and last elements, the second and second-to-last elements, and so on, to obtain
an array with the minimal ordering.

The second step is where the optimization happens. We use a greedy algorithm to swap adjacent elements to ensure
that the largest possible product is obtained. For an array with an even number of elements, we swap adjacent elements
if the second element is larger than the first. For an array with an odd number of elements, we do the same thing
for all but the last two elements, and then we swap the last two elements if the reciprocal of the last element
is larger than the second-to-last element.

After these two steps, we can calculate the value of U using the formula provided, and return the sorted array
and the value of U.
