Question 5
Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two list intersect. Return the intersecting node.
Note the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list
is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.
